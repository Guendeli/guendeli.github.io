Even if my daily work those past months lies in the training / serious VR industry, i'm still a gamer and gamedev at heart, and sometimes i miss high scores, blood splatches and magic explosions particles.
Thus, in my free time rather then spending too many hours of my time [at Portia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/666140/My_Time_At_Portia/), i'm up to the challenge of prototyping a crafing / farming RPG...for mobile. 

## **The 3 C's of Game design: Character Camera Control**
When we speak of games, we mostly mention high level features and concepts. But at it's core, a game will feel right or not from those three basic and fundamental features.
* How do we control our avatar.
* How and from what angle do we see the environment.
* What can we do with a controller in hand.

In my case, i went straight to a Top-down 65Â° view since a mobile screen is not really suitable for free form camera and will add another control in a screen where space is a scarce resource.
As for locomotion, IK and animation retargeting let me use nice height-based features such a climbing and stepping over ledges. 
Feature wise, moving, dodging and interaction (here attacking) are enough for me at this stage.

## **Drop, Equip, Attack**
Well, you can't use the term RPG without having proper inventory and equip features. while i don't have the system implemented right now, i should anticipate and made weapons equippable (either by being instanciated and equiped via script, or from the environement).

Next step will mostly covers a grid based inventory, and triggering equippables or consumables from there.
